## xz - feat(user): Add user liveliness indicator

### Features Implemented
1. User Liveliness Tracking
   - Added `lastLivelinessUpdateAt` field to user data in Redis
   - Implemented periodic liveliness updates (every 10s) from clients
   - Created new socket events for liveliness updates
   - Added visual indicators showing user status

### Technical Changes
1. Server-Side Changes
   - Enhanced UserRepository with liveliness tracking methods
   - Added `updateLiveliness` and `getLiveliness` methods
   - Modified participant data to include liveliness information
   - Added `updateLiveliness` call on user join in `RoomService`
   - Removed `livelinessUpdated` broadcast from `SocketService`
   - Added `GET /rooms/:id/participants` endpoint for fetching participant list with liveliness data

2. Client-Side Changes
   - Created new LivelinessIndicator component
   - Integrated indicator into DisplayName component (conditionally shown for host)
   - Updated UserList: Non-hosts send `updateLiveliness` via socket; Hosts poll `GET /rooms/:id/participants` every 5s. Removed `livelinessUpdated` socket listener.
   - Refined DisplayName component: added `isHost` prop, used `tailwind-merge`, improved current user text, removed old health system
   - Color-coded status indicators:
     - Green: < 10s
     - Yellow: < 30s
     - Orange: < 1m
     - Red: < 2m
     - Black: ≥ 2m or unknown

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding configurable thresholds for different status colors
- Add ability to disable liveliness tracking for performance
- Consider adding automatic cleanup of stale liveliness data
- Add visual feedback when users become inactive/disconnected
