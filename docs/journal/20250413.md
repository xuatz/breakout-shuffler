## xz - fix(robot): startBreakout command not working for clients

### Bug Fixed
1. Fixed issue where clients were not reacting to the `startBreakout` command from the host
   - The bug was in the roomMachine.ts file in how we handled the ROOM_STATE_UPDATED event
   - We were trying to send events from within an action, which is not how XState works
   - Actions are meant to perform side effects, not trigger transitions

### Technical Changes
1. State Machine Logic
   - Refactored the ROOM_STATE_UPDATED event handler to use proper XState transition syntax
   - Changed from using actions to send events to using guards and direct transitions
   - Added two separate transition paths:
     - When room state is 'active', transition directly to the 'active' state
     - When room state is 'waiting', transition directly to the 'waiting' state
   - Kept debug logging to help diagnose any future issues

### Future Considerations
- Consider refactoring the user ID extraction into a shared utility function to avoid duplication between roomMachine.ts and activeRoom.ts
- Add more robust error handling for cases where the cookie might not be available
- Consider adding more comprehensive logging throughout the application to help diagnose similar issues in the future
