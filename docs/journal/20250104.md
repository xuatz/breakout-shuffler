I'm still on phase one. But a lot of the features are pretty much implemented now, just pending some fine tuning.

## Todo 1
For example, I think while the server should persist some information such as rooms created and who was the owner. it shouldn't contain any information about the users, since this state is entirely dependent on socket.io, so let's use that instead (TODO).

## Todo 2
I think we can store some basic information about the users
such as displayName in redis. So that the names can persist 
across server restart/crash. Some code change is required in
both client and server, for example:
1. when user sends `registerClient` message, we should
  probably take the chance to give the user a randomly
  generated name.
    1. to keep things simple, im thinking to append a 3 digit
      random number to reduce hash collision  
2. but then we will allow the users to easily rename themselves
  haven't decide how i will do this tho
