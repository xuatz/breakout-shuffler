## xz - feat(debug): hide ping button unless debug mode enabled

### Features Implemented
1. Debug Mode UI Control
   - Modified UserList component to hide ping button by default
   - Only shows ping button when debug mode is enabled via top bar menu
   - Maintains existing debug ping functionality when enabled

### Technical Changes
1. UserList Component
   - Added '_debug' cookie to useCookies hook
   - Added conditional rendering for ping button based on cookie value
   - Preserved existing debug ping socket event handling

### Future Considerations
- Consider consolidating other debug features under the same debug mode toggle
- Review other UI elements that might benefit from debug mode control
