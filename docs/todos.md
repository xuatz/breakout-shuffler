# Project TODOs

## Bugs

- [ ] when users reconnect, sometimes a page refresh is required before the room information shows up

## Short-term Tasks
- [ ] (host) nudge user feature
- [ ] (user) UI feedback from getting kicked from host
- [ ] hide "ping" button unless debug mode on

## Roadmap-derived Tasks
### Group Management
- [ ] Handle late-joining participants (purgatory area)
- [ ] Different UIs for host/participants in active state
- [ ] Group naming/labeling features
- [ ] Implement repeat minimization algorithm for group assignments

### Health System
- [ ] Implement interactive health actions (damage/heal/train)
- [ ] Add stats tracking system
  - Track damage dealt
  - Track healing provided
  - Track training sessions
  - Implement cross-session persistence

## Adhoc Ideas & Improvements
- [ ] Host can "freeze" users that abuse the nudge feature (separate tab)
- [ ] Need to think about how the application should handle new participants joining during an active room session
- [ ] room ids can be shorter (maybe 10 char long?)
- [ ] add UI feedback for participants when clicking on buttons such as `Nudge Host`
- [ ] increase button sizes on mobile view
